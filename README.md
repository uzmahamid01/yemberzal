**Yemberzal** is more than just a search engine for Kashmiri clothing. It is a digital platform dedicated to promoting the rich heritage and cultural legacy of Kashmiri fashion. As a Kashmiri myself, I understand the beauty and significance of the traditional garments that define our identity. This platform is designed to make discovering and purchasing Kashmiri clothing easier for people across the world, while showcasing the artistry of local artisans.

🌐 Explore the frontend of the project ![here](). The backend deployment is currently in progress, and I’d love your feedback to help improve it further.

If you know of any brands interested in joining Yemberzal, feel free to connect them to us. I’m also open to collaborations—reach out at yemberzal@gmail.com.

Let’s work together to preserve and promote Kashmiri fashion and culture!
